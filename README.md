# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## milestone_2

Shows basic components of a hangman setup. 

- Creates a list of words stored in a variable called 'word_list'

- Selects a random word from the list stored in a variable called 'word'

- User input is then validated to check if it is a letter and is a single character long.

A progression of milestone_2
